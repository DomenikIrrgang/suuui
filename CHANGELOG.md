# Changelog

## Unreleased

### New

- **Talents window:** your talents in a window of their own (N, or the micro menu), the three trees side by side with the game's own talent tooltips. Points are planned until you press Apply. A note tells you when you have talent points to spend.
- **Legacy window** in SuuUI's look:
  - your points, the three trees, and challenges by category, each with its full list;
  - the reward track along the window's foot.
  The micro menu marks the Legacy button, and a note appears, while you have Legacy points to spend.
- **Professions window:**
  - your professions at a glance, unlearned ones too;
  - unlearning, after typing UNLEARN to confirm;
  - dragging a profession's spells (Disenchant, Smelting) onto your bars;
  - recipe lists with grouped filters and sorting;
  - where a recipe you don't know yet is learned;
  - linking a profession or a recipe in chat.
- **Tracked recipes** in the objective tracker, under your quests. A click opens the recipe.
- **Social window:**
  - your friends, with your BattleTag and status at the top;
  - recent allies, with pins and notes;
  - friend requests, and ignoring players;
  - raid groups where you drag members from group to group;
  - your raid lockouts.
- **Friends and guild members coming online** (and going offline) as notes, with Whisper and Invite.
- **Guild window:**
  - guild chat with the message of the day on top;
  - a roster with a class column and each member's details;
  - guild and officer notes edited with one click;
  - promote, demote and remove;
  - the guild information and the guild log;
  - guild settings: ranks, permissions, bank tabs and the Discord link.
- **Group Finder** (first version): one list of groups and players looking for groups, from the game's group finder and from public chat (LookingForGroup, General, Trade, Say and Yell). Filters and an "Only what fits me" switch. Whatever concerns you is highlighted at the top, for example a group for what you're listed for that needs your role, or one for a quest in your log. Whisper or Invite right from the list. Each group shows what it has (its members' roles) and what it still needs, your role highlighted. SuuUI joins LookingForGroup for this and keeps it out of your chat windows. Listing yourself happens in the game's own panel, now in SuuUI's look. While you're listed, My listing shows your listing and an ad for chat you can edit and post with a click.
- **Group invites that ask for your role** come as a notification card with the role choices on it.
- **Group Finder notes:** a group for what you're listed for that needs your role, a new group for it, a player for your group, a group for a quest in your log or in your zone, friends and guild members looking, groups you whispered (posted again, full, gone), stale results (Refresh, Delist), your listing running out (Delist, Open listing) and ending. They wait while you fight or are in a dungeon. `/suu lfgnotes` shows each. Korean posts in LookingForGroup now join the list too. **Settings › Group Finder** turns each kind on or off with its options, and picks the chat channels read, the ad's channel and how long chat posts stay.
- **Right-click menus** in SuuUI's look. The game's dropdown menus and popups are restyled while they show.

### Changed

- Notes now hide while an open window covers them. Requests (popups, loot rolls) stay on top.
- The Talents and Legacy windows open in the middle of the screen, side by side.
- Loot rolls, readiness and the timeline recognise players by their whole name, since Forever's characters have surnames.

### Fixed

- Opening Edit Mode with SuuUI's XP bar on no longer raises a Lua error (`StatusTrackingManager.lua:228`).
- After a `/reload` in combat, buffs, the Cooldown Manager and other modules that don't need secure frames now start at once, instead of waiting for the fight to end.
- The spellbook opened in combat shows SuuUI's page.
- Stance and pet buttons no longer cause an error when a cooldown sweep ends.
- The Character window no longer causes errors in combat.
- The spellbook no longer lists a stance twice (from a flyout).
- Popups hosted in the notification stack (the death popup) keep their buttons side by side.

## 0.2.0-beta.2 (2026-10-13)

### Changed

- SuuUI is now on **Wago Addons** too. The addon itself is unchanged since 0.2.0-beta.1.
